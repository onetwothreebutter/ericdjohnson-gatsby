      that I organized in April 2017. I tried to design the logo so that it was clear what the race participants were raising money for. I also tried to keep the level of detail down so it would work well on a t-shirt.

      Iowa Transplant Bumper Sticker
    </h2>
    <p

      Iowa has a famous "Iowa Native" sticker. My wife is from Illinois but considers herself an Iowan now, so I designed this sticker for her. I've put it up for sale online and at a few local shops, and it's been pretty popular in the area.

      Major League Reading
    </h2>
    <p
      className="site__paragraph-text"

      I love baseball, and I also love reading. I wanted to create a sticker that would help celebrate reading as much as people celebrate sports. The design was noticed by 
      <a
        className="site__paragraph-link"

      , and I licensed the design to them for a year. It's also available online and in local shops.

      Iowa City Book Festival

      Due to my involvement in the local t-shirt scene and my wife's involvement in the Iowa City literary community, I was asked to do the t-shirts for the 2011 Iowa City Book Festival t-shirts. Below is the design I created using the festival's logo.
